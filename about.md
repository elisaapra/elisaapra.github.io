            <p class="about">
              I'm a graphic designer currently studying at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. I get really excited about things like posters, branding, and lettering.
               <br><br>
              I'm always on the lookout for fun new projects. If you think you've got one, send me an <a href="mailto:elisa.apra@gmail.com">email!</a>
              <br><br>
            When I'm not working on my latest design project, you can find me attempting a new vegan recipe, continuing my quest to cover everything
              I own in washi tape, or on <a href="http://twitter.com/aviliane">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/gracidea">Instagram.</a>
