For its December 2014 issue, the Hanford Gyre newspaper explored the
            issue of teen homelessness; I was asked to create this infographic
            examining the topic both in the local community and on the national level.

This piece was later entered into the Visual Communications competition
            at the 2015 Washington State Journalism Conference, where it received a Superior.
