For its December 2014 issue, the Hanford Gyre newspaper explored the
            issue of teen homelessness; I was asked to create this infographic
            examining the topic both in the local community and on the national level.

This piece later received a superior in the Visual Communications category
            at the 2015 Washington State Journalism Conference.
